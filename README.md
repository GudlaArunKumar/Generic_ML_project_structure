## End to End Machine Learning Project 

This project is an end to end implmentation of a data science project which includes modular programming style (classes and functional code style), pipeline-based implementation (data ingestion, data preprocessing, training, and prediction pipelines), exception handling, logging, CI/CD practices, python packaging, and virtual environment setup. I have deployed the project as a web application hosted in Streamlit cloud.
